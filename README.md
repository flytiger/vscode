The goal of this fork is to make a version of vscode that can have fully working window transparency and nice effects to go with that.

## Packaging
vscode can be packaged for: `win32-ia32 | win32-x64 | darwin | linux-ia32 | linux-x64 | linux-arm`
- `gulp` is used to package
  - `vscode-[platform]`: Builds a packaged version for [platform]
  - `vscode-[platform]-min`: Builds a packaged and minified version for [platform]
    - Note: may need to add `--max-old-space-size=6500` to limit the memory used in packaging, my computer crashed a few times trying to package without that flag
